# Deloitte Data science

The repository contains the coding challenge for a data science position at [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html).
Relevant exercise [documents](https://github.com/jeff1evesque/deloitte-data-exercise/tree/master/data)
can be reviewed, prior to running each of the following scripts:

- [`descriptive_statistics.R`](https://github.com/jeff1evesque/deloitte-data-exercise/blob/master/descriptive_statistics.R)
- [`gun_delta_net.R`](https://github.com/jeff1evesque/deloitte-data-exercise/blob/master/gun_delta_net.R)
- [`division_results.R`](https://github.com/jeff1evesque/deloitte-data-exercise/blob/master/division_results.R)
- [`chris_doe.R`](https://github.com/jeff1evesque/deloitte-data-exercise/blob/master/chris_doe.R)

**Note:** a custom [`deloitteUtility`](https://github.com/jeff1evesque/deloitte-data-exercise/tree/master/packages/deloitteUtility)
package was created, invoked automatically by each of the above scripts.

Though the generated [visualizations](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rbn6y3fzkuj6p8r/AACMXSYY6-MtYRmb4KNLw0PHa?dl=0),
as well as the submitted [slide-deck](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/66hm7m6r6mat20o/AACvzeltcyUjbQ8GNnFNudG2a?dl=0)
have not been committed in this repository, they were submitted along with this full repository prior to the final
interview. Additionally, the above scripts was developed within [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), in case any
troubles arise with the terminal cli implementation.
